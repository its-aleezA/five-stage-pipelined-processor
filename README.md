# Five-Stage Pipelined Processor (Verilog)

This project implements a five-stage pipelined processor in Verilog with comprehensive hazard handling. It demonstrates instruction-level parallelism using forwarding, stalling, and hazard detection techniques across modular RTL design. The processor supports a MIPS-like instruction set and simulates real-world data and control hazards.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This Verilog-based CPU project is designed to simulate a five-stage pipelined processor with support for:

- Stall-only hazard handling
- Forwarding-only hazard handling
- Combined stall + forwarding mode

It handles data and control hazards, includes a testbench, and is built with reusable modules for each pipeline stage.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Full 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back
- Implements forwarding and stalling mechanisms
- Hazard detection and resolution units
- Branch prediction logic (basic PCSRC control)
- Modular RTL components
- Instruction and data memory
- Comprehensive simulation testbench

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Verilog
- **Simulator:** ModelSim / Vivado / Xilinx ISim
- **Design Units:** Modular RTL components
- **Testbench:** Included (only for the top module)

| Stage      | Module(s)           | Description                          |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IF (Fetch) | `pc`, `inst_mem`    | Fetch instruction from memory        |
| ID (Decode)| `Decoder`, `reg_file`, `IFID`, `ControlUnit` | Decode instruction, fetch operands |
| EX         | `IDEX`, `Alu`, `AluSrc`, `ForwardingUnit`, `ForwardMux` | Execute ALU ops and forward data |
| MEM        | `EXMEM`, `datamemory` | Access memory for lw/sw instructions |
| WB         | `MEMWB`, `memTOregMux` | Write result back to registers      |
